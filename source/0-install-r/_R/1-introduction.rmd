Installing R

**Background R software**
-------------------------

*R* is perhaps the most powerful computer environment for data analysis that is currently available. *R* is both a computer *language*, that allows you to write instructions, and a *program* that responds to these instructions. *R* has core functionality to read and write files, manipulate and summarize data, run statistical tests and models, make fancy plots, and many more things like that. This core functionality is extended by hundreds of packages (plug-ins). Some of these packages provide more advanced generic functionality, others provide cutting-edge methods that are only used in highly specialized analysis. 

Because of its versatility, *R* has become very popular across data analysts in many fields, from agronomy to bioinformatics, ecology, finance, geography, pharmacology and psychology. You can read about it in this article in [Nature](http://www.nature.com/news/programming-tools-adventures-with-r-1.16609) or in the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/technology/business-computing/07program.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0). So you probably should learn *R* if you want to be good in data analysis, be a successful researcher, collaborate, get a [high paying](http://www.sfgate.com/technology/businessinsider/article/10-Tech-Skills-That-Will-Earn-You-Over-100-000-5193599.php) data science job, ... If you are not that much into *data analysis and visualization* but want to learn programming for more general tasks, you may want to start with [python](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/) instead. 

This document provides a concise introduction to *R*. It emphasizes what you need to know to be able to use the language in any context. There is no fancy statistical analysis here. We just present the basics of the *R* language itself. We do not assume that you have done any computer programming before (and if that is the case, we do assume that you think it is about time you did). Experienced *R* users obviously need not read this. However, the material may be useful if you want to refresh your memory, if you have not used *R* much, or if you feel confused. 

When using this resource, it is very important to follow [Norman Matloff](https://www.nostarch.com/artofr.htm)'s advice: *"When in doubt, try it out!"*. That is, test yourself. Copy the examples shown, and then make modifications to see if you can predict what will happen. Only then will you really understand what is going on. You are learning a language, and you will have to use it a lot to become good at it. So express yourself and accept that for a while you will be stumbling a lot and sometimes feel lost. 

To work with *R* on your own computer, you need to [download](https://cran.r-project.org/) the program and install it. I recommend that you also install [R-Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/). R-Studio is a separate program that makes *R* easier to use. Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIrsOBy5k58) that shows how to work in R-Studio.

After having gone through the chapters presented here, you should could consult additional resources to learn *R*. It is very helpful to read several of these introductions to *R* while you use it in your work. Each time you will pick up new things, and feel accomplished about how much you already understand. There are many free resources on the web, including [R for Beginners](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Paradis-rdebuts_en.pdf) by Emmanuel Paradis and this [tutorial](http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/) by Kelly Black that is similar to the one you are reading now. Or consult this [brief overview](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~ihaka/120/Notes/ch02.pdf) by Ross Ihaka (one of the originators of R) from his [Information Visualization](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~ihaka/120/notes.html) course. You can also consult the more formal "official" [introduction](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf) or get a copy of  Norman Matloff's book [The Art of R Programming](http://www.nostarch.com/artofr.htm). 

There is also a lot of good stuff on [rstatistics.net](http://rstatistics.net/)

If you want to take it easy, or perhaps learn about R while you commute on a packed train, you could watch some [Google Developers videos](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOU2XLYxmsIK9qQfztXeybpHvru-TrqAP).

If none of this appeals to you, and you already are experienced with *R*, or you have done a lot of programming with other languages, skip all of this and perhaps have a look at Hadley Wickham's [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/).

**Installing R on Windows**
---------------------------

[Download](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) the latest R installer (.exe) for Windows. Install the downloaded file as any other windows app. 

___
**Installing Rstudio on Windows**
---------------------------

Now that R is installed, you need to download and install RStudio. 
First [download](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) the installer for Windows. Run the installer (.exe file) and follow the instructions.
