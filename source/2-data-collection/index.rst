Data collection & requirements
==============================

Information about **minimum data requirements** for yield gap decomposition can be `found here <https://jvasco323.github.io/eia-yg-training-ppt/2-silva-data-requirements.pdf>`__. This
minimum data requirement is required to link primary point-based data to secondary spatial data on growth-defining (climate) and -limiting factors (soils), which is needed for yield gap analysis
in addition to primary data on crop management practices (remember again these should cover growth-defining, -limiting, -reducing factors). A group discussion, mixing members of different use cases,
is undertaken to answer the following questions: (1) what type of data are required to conduct to conduct yield gap decomposition, (2) what type of data do you have with you, 
(3) are the data you have enough for yield gap decomposition, and (4) what additional data do you need for yield gap decomposition. After this discussion, we know the data available for each use case, 
and the additional data requirements, for yield gap decomposition. 

The **data collection tool** developed by Excellence in Agronomy for yield gap decomposition is `introduced here <https://jvasco323.github.io/eia-yg-training-ppt/tesfaye-data-collection-tool.pdf>`__. The instrument to 
collect the required data can be accessed in the link below. This instrument is compatible with the `Open Data Kit (ODK) <https://opendatakit.org/software/>`__ and `KoboCollect Toolbox <https://www.kobotoolbox.org/>`__. You 
can request support from members of the global team of Excellence in Agronomy to help you deploy this form, so that the collected data is centralized in a common database system. This is important to ensure that custom-made scripts 
can be used for retrieving secondary data, and for cleaning, curating, and analysing primary data across different use cases. A training on the data collection tool is provided after the tool is introduced, so you have the chance 
to get familiar with tool.
