  abstract = {Abstract Explaining yield gaps is crucial to understand the main technical
	constraints faced by farmers to increase land productivity. The objective
	of this study is to decompose the yield gap into efficiency, resource
	and technology yield gaps for irrigated lowland rice-based farming
	systems in Central Luzon, Philippines, and to explain those yield
	gaps using data related to crop management, biophysical constraints
	and available technologies. Stochastic frontier analysis was used
	to quantify and explain the efficiency and resource yield gaps and
	a crop growth model (ORYZA v3) was used to compute the technology
	yield gap. We combined these two methodologies into a theoretical
	framework to explain rice yield gaps in farmersâ€™ fields included
	in the Central Luzon Loop Survey, an unbalanced panel dataset of
	about 100 households, collected every four to five years during the
	period 1966â€“2012. The mean yield gap estimated for the period 1979â€“2012
	was 3.2 ton haâˆ’1 in the wet season (WS) and 4.8 ton haâˆ’1 in the
	dry season (DS). An average efficiency yield gap of 1.3 ton haâˆ’1
	was estimated and partly explained by untimely application of mineral
	fertilizers and biotic control factors. The mean resource yield gap
	was small in both seasons but somewhat larger in the \{DS\} (1.3
	ton haâˆ’1) than in the \{WS\} (1.0 ton haâˆ’1). This can be partly
	explained by the greater N, P and K use in the highest yielding fields
	than in lowest yielding fields which was observed in the \{DS\} but
	not in the WS. The technology yield gap was on average less than
	1.0 ton haâˆ’1 during the \{WS\} prior to 2003 and ca. 1.6 ton haâˆ’1
	from 2003 to 2012 while in the \{DS\} it has been consistently large
	with a mean of 2.2 ton haâˆ’1. Varietal shift and sub-optimal application
	of inputs (e.g. quantity of irrigation water and N) are the most
	plausible explanations for this yield gap during the \{WS\} and DS,
	respectively. We conclude that the technology yield gap explains
	nearly half of the difference between potential and actual yields
	while the efficiency and resource yield gaps explain each a quarter
	of that difference in the DS. As for the WS, particular attention
	should be given to the efficiency yield gap which, although decreasing
	with time, still accounted for nearly 40% of the overall yield gap.},

	We then review global studies, often performed by non-agricultural
	scientists, aimed at yield and sometimes yield gap assessment and
	compare several studies in terms of outcomes for regions in Nebraska,
	Kenya and The Netherlands. Based on our review we recommend key components
	for a yield gap assessment that can be applied at local to global
	scales. Given lack of data for some regions, the protocol recommends
	use of a tiered approach with preferred use of crop growth simulation
	models applied to relatively homogenous climate zones for which measured
	weather data are available. Within such zones simulations are performed
	for the dominant soils and cropping systems considering current spatial
	distribution of crops. Need for accurate agronomic and current yield
	data together with calibrated and validated crop models and upscaling
	methods is emphasized. The bottom-up application of this global protocol
	allows verification of estimated yield gaps with on-farm data and

  abstract = {In rainfed crop production, root zone plant-available water holding capacity (RZ-PAWHC) of the soil has a large influence on crop growth and the yield response to management inputs such as improved seeds and fertilisers. However, data are lacking for this parameter in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This study produced the first spatially explicit, coherent and complete maps of the rootable depth and RZ-PAWHC of soil in SSA. We compiled geo-referenced data from 28,000 soil profiles from SSA, which were used as input for digital soil mapping (DSM) techniques to produce soil property maps of SSA. Based on these soil properties, we developed and parameterised (pedotransfer) functions, rules and criteria to evaluate soil water retention at field capacity and wilting point, the soil fine earth fraction from coarse fragments content and, for maize, the soil rootability (relative to threshold values) and rootable depth. Maps of these secondary soil properties were derived using the primary soil property maps as input for the evaluation rules and the results were aggregated over the rootable depth to obtain a map of RZ-PAWHC, with a spatial resolution of 1 km2. The mean RZ-PAWHC for SSA is 74 mm and the associated average root zone depth is 96 cm. Pearson correlation between the two is 0.95. RZ-PAWHC proves most limited by the rootable depth but is also highly sensitive to the definition of field capacity. The total soil volume of SSA potentially rootable by maize is reduced by one third (over 10,500 km3) due to soil conditions restricting root zone depth. Of these, 4800 km3 are due to limited depth of aeration, which is the factor most severely limiting in terms of extent (km2), and 2500 km3 due to sodicity which is most severely limiting in terms of degree (depth in cm). Depth of soil to bedrock reduces the rootable soil volume by 2500 km3, aluminium toxicity by 600 km3, porosity by 120 km3 and alkalinity by 20 km3. The accuracy of the map of rootable depth and thus of RZ-PAWHC could not be validated quantitatively due to absent data on rootability and rootable depth but is limited by the accuracy of the primary soil property maps. The methodological framework is robust and has been operationalised such that the maps can easily be updated as additional data become available.},

Stochastic frontier analysis was used to disentangle efficiency and resource yield gaps, whereas data on rice yield potential in the region were retrieved from the Global Yield Gap Atlas to estimate the technology yield gap. Rice yield gaps were small (ca. 2.7 t ha−1, or 20% of potential yield, Yp) and mostly attributed to the technology yield gap (ca. 1.8 t ha−1, or ca. 15% of Yp). Efficiency and resource yield gaps were negligible (less than 5% of Yp in most districts). Small yield gaps were associated with high input use, particularly irrigation water and N, for which small yield responses were observed. N partial factor productivity (PFP-N) was 45–50 kg grain kg−1 N for fields with efficient N management and approximately 20% lower for the fields with inefficient N management. Improving PFP-N appears to be best achieved through better matching of N rates to the variety types cultivated and by adjusting the amount of urea applied in the 3rd split in correspondance with the amount of diammonium-phosphate applied earlier in the season. Future studies should assess the potential to reduce irrigation water without compromising rice yield and to broaden the assessment presented here to other indicators and at the cropping systems level.},

  abstract = {Arable farming systems in the Netherlands are characterized by crop rotations in which potato, sugar beet, spring onion, winter wheat and spring barley are the most important crops. The objectives of this study were to decompose crop yield gaps within such rotations into efficiency, resource and technology yield gaps and to explain those yield gaps based on observed cropping frequencies and alternative farmers' objectives. Data from specialized Dutch arable farms between 2008 and 2012 were used. Production frontiers and efficiency yield gaps were estimated using the stochastic frontier framework. The resource yield gap was quantified through the estimation of highest farmers' yields (YHF, average across farms with actual yields above the 90th percentile). Crop model simulations and variety trials were compiled to assess climatic potential yields (Yp) and technology yield gaps. The contribution of crop area shares and farmers' objectives to actual yields were assessed using regression analysis and based on five different farm level indicators (N production, energy production, gross margin, nitrogen-use efficiency and labour use), respectively. The average yield gap per crop (as percentage of Yp which is given in parentheses) was: 29.2% (of 72.6t haâˆ’1) for ware potato, 39.7% (of 71.6t haâˆ’1) for starch potato, 26.4% (of 107.1t haâˆ’1) for sugar beet, 32.3% (of 88.3t haâˆ’1) for spring onion, 25.2% (of 12.3t haâˆ’1) for winter wheat and 37.5% (of 10.4t haâˆ’1) for spring barley. The efficiency yield gap ranged between 6.6% (starch potato) and 18.1% (spring onion) of Yp. The resource yield gap was lower than 10% of Yp for all the crops and the technology yield gap ranged between 7.1% (ware potato) and 30.7% of Yp (starch potato). There were statistically significant effects of potato (positive quadratic) and onion (positive) area shares on ware potato, sugar beet and winter wheat yields, of sugar beet area share (positive quadratic) on winter wheat yield and of cereal area share (negative) on sugar beet and winter wheat yields. Farmers' objectives explain part of the variability observed in crop yields which were 7â€“24%, 13â€“24% and 12â€“32% lower than YHF, respectively, for gross margin maximising, labour minimising and N use efficiency maximising farms. In addition, there was a significant positive relationship between gross margin and the yield of ware potato, sugar beet and winter wheat. By contrast, no significant relationships were found between crop yields and NUE or labour use. We conclude that most of the yield gap is explained by the efficiency yield gap for ware potato and spring onion and by both the efficiency and technology yield gaps for sugar beet and cereals. The resource yield gap explains most of the yield gap of seed potato, and the technology yield gap of starch potato. The results regarding the effects of cropping frequency and crop rotations to crop yields are not very conclusive which suggest that agronomic principles become less evident at â€˜systems levelâ€™ given the number of interacting factors at crop rotation level. Finally, although N and energy production are lower for gross margin maximising farms, most crop yields are not significantly different between farms with the highest N and energy production compared to farms performing best on economic (gross margin) objectives.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT
Recent studies on yield gap analysis for rice in Southeast Asia revealed different levels of intensification across the main ‘rice bowls’ in the region. Identifying the key crop management and biophysical drivers of rice yield gaps across different ‘rice bowls’ provides opportunities for comparative analyses, which are crucial to better understand the scope to narrow yield gaps and increase resource-use efficiencies across the region.
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this study was to decompose rice yield gaps into their efficiency, resource, and technology components and to map the scope to sustainably increase rice production across four lowland irrigated rice areas in Southeast Asia through improved crop management.
METHODS
A novel framework for yield gap decomposition accounting for the main genotype, management, and environmental factors explaining crop yield in intensive rice irrigated systems was developed. A combination of crop simulation modelling at field-level and stochastic frontier analysis was applied to household survey data to identify the drivers of yield variability and to disentangle efficiency, resource, and technology yield gaps, including decomposing the latter into its sowing date and genotype components.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The yield gap was greatest in Bago, Myanmar (75% of Yp), intermediate in Yogyakarta, Indonesia (57% of Yp) and in Nakhon Sawan, Thailand (47% of Yp), and lowest in Can Tho, Vietnam (44% of Yp). The yield gap in Myanmar was largely attributed to the resource yield gap, reflecting a large scope to sustainably intensify rice production through increases in fertilizer use and proper weed control (i.e., more output with more inputs). In Vietnam, the yield gap was mostly attributed to the technology yield gap and to resource and efficiency yield gaps in the dry season and wet season, respectively. Yet, sustainability aspects associated with inefficient use of fertilizer and low profitability from high input levels should also be considered alongside precision agriculture technologies for site-specific management (i.e., more output with the same or less inputs). The same is true in Thailand, where the yield gap was equally explained by the technology, resource, and efficiency yield gaps. The yield gap in Indonesia was mostly attributed to efficiency and technology yield gaps and yield response curves to N based on farmer field data in this site suggest it is possible to reduce its use while increasing rice yield (i.e., more output with less inputs).
SIGNIFICANCE
This study provides a novel approach to decomposing rice yield gaps in Southeast Asia's main rice producing areas. By breaking down the yield gap into different components, context-specific opportunities to narrow yield gaps were identified to target sustainable intensification of rice production in the region.},

  abstract = {Maize is an important staple crop in Ethiopia. Reducing the yield gap - the difference between actual and (water-limited) potential yield - has wide implications for food security and policy. In this paper we combine stochastic frontier analysis of household survey data with agronomic information on (water-limited) potential yield to decompose the maize yield gap in Ethiopia and highlight policy solutions to reduce the yield gap. Our analysis suggests that lack of access to advanced technologies makes up the largest component of the maize yield gap but market imperfections, economic constraints and management constraints are also important determinants. Potentially, maize production can be increased almost fivefold if all these constraints would be addressed simultaneously and the yield gap could be fully closed. Another finding of the paper is measurement issues in the national household survey (LSMS-ISA), a key source of information for scientists to assess agricultural policies in Ethiopia and other African countries. A comparison with results from a crop model suggests a large number of unrealistic values related to key maize input and output variables. Combining economic and agronomic approaches is therefore not only useful to identify policies to reduce maize yield gaps, but also to assess and improve the quality of data-bases on which recommendations are made.},
