This talk highlights the methods and approaches most widely used so
far for yield gap decomposition using farmer field data. An overview of how 
(i) crop models, (ii) data-driven approaches (e.g., frontier analysis and machine 
learning), and (iii) experimental and expert-based approaches have been used for 
yield gap decomposition is provided and illustrated with examples from the literature.
