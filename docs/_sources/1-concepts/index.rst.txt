Concepts and definitions
========================

--------------

**(1) Global Yield Gap Atlas**
------------------------------
**Martin van Ittersum**, WUR

Download slides `here <https://jvasco323.github.io/eia-yg-training-ppt/vanittersum-gyga.pdf>`__.

This talk highlights the current and future applications of the `Global Yield Gap Atlas <http://www.yieldgap.org/>`__. You will
learn about the platform and the types of data that it provides to inform food security and resource
use efficiency assessments globally. Examples of different applications out of the data from the 
`Global Yield Gap Atlas <http://www.yieldgap.org/>`__ are provided.

**(2) Yield levels and yield gaps**
-----------------------------------
**Kindie Tesfaye**, CIMMYT

Download slides `here <https://jvasco323.github.io/eia-yg-training-ppt/tesfaye-yieldlevels.pdf>`__.

This talk highlights the different yield levels defined so far in the context of production ecology. Those 
yield levels are explained in detail in this talk. An overview of how to estimate the different yield levels 
using farm surveys, field experiments, and crop simulation models is provided.

**(3) Yield gap decomposition**
-------------------------------
**Jo√£o Vasco Silva**, CIMMYT

Download slides `here <https://jvasco323.github.io/eia-yg-training-ppt/1-silva-ygd-overview.pdf>`__.

This talk highlights the methods and approaches most widely used so 
far for yield gap decomposition using farmer field data. An overview of how 
crop models and data-driven approaches (e.g., frontier analysis and machine 
learning) have been used for yield gap decomposition is provided and 
illustrated with examples from the literature.
