This section provides the workflow to conduct yield gap decomposition using boundary line analysis. `Introductory slides can be downloaded here <https://jvasco323.github.io/eia-yg-training-ppt/4-silva-boundary-lines.pdf>`__. You will learn 
(a) how to identify the boundary points, (b) how to fit a continuous function to the boundary points,
(c) how to estimate the yield gap for single production factors, and (d) how to identify the most limiting factor, 
by analogy with `von Liebigâ€™s law of the minimum <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liebig%27s_law_of_the_minimum>`__, and decompose the yield gap for individual farm fields.
