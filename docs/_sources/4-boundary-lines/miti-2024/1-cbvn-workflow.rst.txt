**Introduction**
----------------

The censored bivariate normal model (`Lark and Milne,
2016 <https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.12318>`__) is a statistical method of
fitting the boundary line. It fits the boundary line using the maximum
likelihood approach on a censored bivariate distribution. This removes
the subjectivity of selecting boundary points to which the boundary line
is fitted. It also gives evidence for presence of a boundary in the data
set. This method has been previously used to fit boundary lines to data
on nitrous oxide emission as a function of soil moisture (`Lark and
Milne, 2016 <https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.12318>`__) and, Wheat yield as
a function of Nutrient concentration (`Lark et al.,
2020 <https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.12891>`__). An R package, called
‘BLA’, contains exploratory and boundary line fitting functions that can
be used in the process of fitting a boundary line to data using the
censored bivariate normal model. This workflow provides a step by step
process for fitting the boundary line with this approach.

--------------

**Installation of BLA package**
-------------------------------

Below, we need install the R packages required to run this workflow.

.. code:: r

   # problem with this package, install from source
   install.packages('https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/aplpack_1.3.5.tar.gz', repos=NULL, type="source", quiet=T)
   library(aplpack)
   #
   # package names
   packages <- c("MASS", "mvtnorm")
   #
   # install packages
   installed_packages <- packages %in% rownames(installed.packages())
   if(any(installed_packages == FALSE)){
     install.packages(packages[!installed_packages], repos="http://cran.us.r-project.org", quiet=T)}
   #
   # load packages
   invisible(lapply(packages, function(x) suppressMessages(require(x, character.only=T, quietly=T, warn.conflicts=F))))

You also need to install the ‘BLA’ package (under development) from
GitHub:

.. code:: r

   file <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jvasco323/eia-yg-training-ppt/master/BLA_1.0.6.zip'
   install.packages(file, repos=NULL)
   ## Installing package into 'C:/Users/JSILVA/AppData/Local/R/win-library/4.3'
   ## (as 'lib' is unspecified)
   ## package 'BLA' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked
   library(BLA)

--------------

**Load data set**
-----------------

The data set used for this illustration in this workflow consists of
wheat yield and soil phosphorus data. Boundary line analysis was applied
this data set in a previous study by `Lark et al.,
(2020) <https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.12891>`__.

The data can be loaded into R software using the chunk of code below:

.. code:: r

   file <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jvasco323/eia-yg-training-ppt/master/my_data_trimed.csv'
   data <- read.csv(url(file), header=TRUE)
   head(data)
   ##   yield.t.ha. Phosphorus_ppm
   ## 1     9.55787             10
   ## 2     8.88999              9
   ## 3    11.88140             12
   ## 4    10.35740             10
   ## 5    12.62530             14
   ## 6    11.64170             11

We wish to fit a boundary line to wheat yield data as function of soil
phosphorus concentration.

**Data exploration**
--------------------

Exploratory analysis is an essential initial step in fitting a boundary
line to data. This step ensures that the assumptions for the censored
bivariate normal model are met. Three exploratory procedures are
performed on the data which include (1) testing for normality of
variables, (2) removal of outliers, and (3) testing for evidence of
boundary in the data.

**1. Testing for normality of independent and dependent variable**

Boundary line model fitting using *cbvn* requires that the independent
(*x*) and dependent (*y*) variables are normally distributed. The
*summa()* function gives indices of the distribution of a variable. A
variable is assumed to be normally distributed if the skewness index is
between -1 and 1. The *summaplot()* function provides a visual
description of the data distribution.

.. code:: r

   x <- data$Phosphorus_ppm 
   y <- data$yield.t.ha.
   #
   summaplot(x) # histogram and qqplot for distribution of x

|image1|

.. code:: r

   summa(x) # gives indices for skewness; the skewness is 1.84 which is outside the normal distribution range of -1 to 1: data transformation is thus required 
   ##          Mean Median Quartile.1 Quartile.3 Variance      SD Skewness
   ## [1,] 25.22307     21         15         31 203.4532 14.2637 1.786871
   ##      Octile skewness Kurtosis No. outliers
   ## [1,]       0.3793103 5.303787           22
   summa(log(x)) 
   ##          Mean   Median Quartile.1 Quartile.3  Variance        SD  Skewness
   ## [1,] 3.091277 3.044522    2.70805   3.433987 0.2681185 0.5178016 0.1260458
   ##      Octile skewness   Kurtosis No. outliers
   ## [1,]      0.08906724 -0.1011968            0
   summaplot(log(x)) 

|image2|

.. code:: r

   #
   # distribution of the y variable
   summa(y) # gives indices for skewness; the skewness is -0.48 which is within the normal distribution range of -1 to 1
   ##          Mean  Median Quartile.1 Quartile.3 Variance       SD   Skewness
   ## [1,] 9.290768 9.45873   8.231085    10.5264 3.820238 1.954543 -0.6748272
   ##      Octile skewness Kurtosis No. outliers
   ## [1,]     -0.07020916 1.306502            6
   summaplot(y) # histogram and qqplot for distribution of y

|image3|

**2. Removal of outliers**

Boundary line analysis is sensitive to outlying values and hence it is
required that they are identified and excluded prior to fitting a
boundary line. A bag plot (a bivariate box plot) is used to identify
outliers. The bag plot has four main components: (1) a depth median
(equivalent to the median in a boxplot) which represents the center of
the data set, (2) the bag which contains 50% of the data points
(equiavalent to the interquartile range), (3) a ‘fence’ that separates
probable outliers, and (4) a loop which contains points outside the bag
which are not outliers.

.. code:: r

   x <- log(x) # since we requred a transformation
   df <- data.frame(x,y) 
   bag <- bagplot(df,show.whiskers = FALSE)
   legend("topright", c("bag","loop","outliers", "d.median"), 
              pch = c(15,15,16,8),col=c("blue","lightblue","red","red"))

|image4|

.. code:: r

   #
   # combine data points from "bag" and within the loop
   dat <- rbind(bag$pxy.bag,bag$pxy.outer)
   #
   # output is a matrix, we can pull out x and y variables for next stage 
   x <- dat[,1] 
   y <- dat[,2]

**3. Testing data for presence of boundary**

It is important to note that not all data are suitable for boundary line
analysis. Data used in boundary line analysis should exhibit some form
of boundary on its edges (to satisfy the assumption that this is an
actual response when other factors are not limiting). If a boundary
exists in a data set, it is expected that points at the upper edges of
the data cloud will be close to each other compared to a bivariate
normally distributed data for which data points at the upper edges are
only due to random error. A boundary can be assumed in a data set if
there is evidence of clustering at the upper edges. The *expl.boundary()
function,* which is based on the convex hull, can be used to access
presence of boundary (`Milne et al.,
2006 <https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7348.2006.00085.x>`__). This
function checks probability of the observed clustering if it came from a
bivariate normal distribution (p-value).

.. code:: r

   expl.boundary(x,y) # may take about 2 minutes to complete

|image5|\ |image6|

::

   ##     Index Section    value
   ## 1      sd    Rise 1.082113
   ## 2      sd    Fall 1.195613
   ## 3 Mean sd    Rise 1.243657
   ## 4 Mean sd    Fall 1.355574
   ## 5 p_value    Rise 0.010000
   ## 6 p_value    Fall 0.018000

From the results, the probability (p-value) of the having observations
close to each other in our data, assuming it follows a bivariate normal
distribution, is less than 5%. Therefore, there is evidence of bounding
effects in the data. Note that, in the plot, the data is split into
right and left sections to get more information on the clustering nature
of points.

--------------

**Fitting the boundary line**
-----------------------------

The exploratory tests previously conducted provide evidence of a
boundary in the data set, given that outliers were identified and
excluded, and the variables *x* and *y* are normally distributed. We
therefore, proceed to fit a boundary line model to the data set using
the censored bivariate normal model. The *cbvn()* function fits the
boundary line to the data. For more information about the arguments of
this function, check:

.. code:: r

   ?cbvn

Argument values for the function *cbvn()* need to be set. First, let’s
create a data-frame containing *x* and *y*:

.. code:: r

   vals <- data.frame(x,y) # this is an input dataframe containing the variables

Secondly, the *cbvn()* function requires initial starting values,
*theta*, which are parameters of the boundary line (the censor) and the
bivariate normal distribution. Starting values of the boundary line
depend on the model that one wishes to fit to the data (see options in
*?cbvn*). In this case, we shall fit a linear plateau model (‘lp’) and
hence the parameters are the plateau value and the intercept and slope
of the linear component. The boundary line start values can be obtained
using the function *startValues()*. With a scatter plot of *y* against
*x* active in the plot window in R, run the function *start.values(2)*,
then click on the plot, the point you expect to be the lowest and the
largest response of a linear model at the boundary.

.. code:: r

   # note this step will only work in R or Rstudio
   plot(x,y)
   startValues(n=2) 

Parameters of the bivariate normal distribution include the means of the
*x* and *y* variables, standard deviation of the *x* and *y* variables,
and the correlation of *x* and *y*.

.. code:: r

   # required parameters
   mean(x) 
   ## [1] 3.092809
   mean(y) 
   ## [1] 9.324846
   sd(x) 
   ## [1] 0.5153963
   sd(y) 
   ## [1] 1.882962
   cor(x,y)
   ## [1] 0.04729519
   #
   # the parameters of the boundary line and the data can be combined in a vector theta
   theta <- c(13.6, 4, 3, 3.13, 9.29, 0.5, 1.73, 0.03) 

Another important argument is the standard deviation of the measurement
error, *sigh*. This value can be obtained from standard deviation of
repeated measurements of the sample if this is possible. However, in
cases when this is not available, it can be estimated from the data. One
option of estimation is to use a variogram if the location data (xy
coordinates) is available. In this case, nugget variance which is the
unexplained short distance variations can be taken as an estimate of the
measurement error. The variogram below was obtained in the study for
which the data used in this example is based.

|image7|

From the variogram, the nugget variance was found to be 0.435.

.. code:: r

   sigh <- sqrt(0.435) # standard deviation of the measurement error 0.66

All arguments are now set, the *cbvn()* can be fitted:

.. code:: r

   model1 <- cbvn(vals,theta,sigh,model = "lp", xlab=expression("P /log ppm"), ylab=expression("Yield /t ha"^{-1}))
   ## Warning in sqrt(diag(covpar)): NaNs produced

|image8|

.. code:: r

   model1
   ## $estimates
   ##          Estimate Standard error
   ## beta0 13.13820654    0.165731302
   ## beta1  0.51414702    0.100312067
   ## beta2  5.48249907            NaN
   ## mux    3.09278135    0.008601939
   ## muy    9.33714255    0.032071625
   ## sdx    0.51532725    0.006082414
   ## sdy    1.78781765    0.025362137
   ## rcorr  0.04415286    0.017695779
   ## 
   ## $AIC
   ##                      
   ## constant max 20157.10
   ## mvn          20155.10
   ## BL           20139.98

Is the boundary line ideal for this data?

While fitting the BL model to the data, the *cbvn()* also fits a model
with a constant boundary alone and also multivariate normal models with
no boundary. From our output, the AIC value of the boundary line model
is lower than that of the constant maximum and multivariate normal
models. Therefore, the boundary line model is appropriate for this data
set.

The parameters of the boundary line are obtained and hence can be used
to predict the boundary yield for any given value of soil phosphorous,
as per the chunk of code below.

.. code:: r

   yield_pred <- vector()
   for(i in 1:length(data$P)){
     yield_pred[i] <- min(model1$estimates[2,1]+ model1$estimates[3,1]*log(data$P[i]), model1$estimates[1,1])}
   data$yield_pred <- yield_pred
   head(data)
   ##   yield.t.ha. Phosphorus_ppm yield_pred
   ## 1     9.55787             10   13.13807
   ## 2     8.88999              9   12.56043

   ## 5    12.62530             14   13.13821
   ## 6    11.64170             11   13.13821
