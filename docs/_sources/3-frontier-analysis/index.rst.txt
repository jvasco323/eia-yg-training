Yield gap decomposition has been increasingly applied in agronomy to disentangle the impact of sub-optimal management on crop production and 
to identify agronomic measures to improve yields in farmers' fields. This workflow aims to formalize the framework introduced by Silva et al. (2017), which combines 
stochastic frontier analysis and crop modelling. Data collected by CIMMYT and EIAR for wheat in Ethiopia (Silva et al., 2021) are used here as an example.
