This section provides the workflow to conduct yield gap decomposition using stochastic frontier analysis. You will learn 
(a) how to fit and interpret a stochastic frontier to farmer field data, (b) how to estimate the efficiency yield gap from the fitted model,
(c) how to estimate the highest farmers' yields and the resource yield gap, and (d) how to estimate the technology yield gap using the water-limited
yields from the `Global Yield Gap Atlas <http://www.yieldgap.org/>`__.
