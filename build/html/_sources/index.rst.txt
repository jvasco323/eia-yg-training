Welcome!
========

This website contains all the material of the training on yield gap decomposition organized by the OneCGIAR initiative on Excellence in Agronomy! 
The training will cover the main methods available for yield gap decomposition using farmer field data, namely stochastic frontier analysis, boundary line analysis, and machine learning. 
It will also provide you with a data collection tool meeting the data requirements to run such analysis.

For this training, you will need the *R* software installed in your machine (). We also recommend you to install Rstudio () as a user friendly interface to *R*. 
Please note this is not a training to learn *R*. If you have never used *R*, or if you need a refresher, you should start with the `Introduction to R <intr/index.html>`__ (`pdf </pdf/Rintro.pdf>`__), kindly prepared by prof. Robert Hijmans.

The schedule for the training is as follows:

* **Day 1**: Concepts & definitions for yield gap decomposition
* **Day 2**: Data collection tool 
* **Day 3**: Hands-on stochastic frontier analysis
* **Day 4**: Hands-on machine learning
* **Day 5**: Introduction to boundary line analysis, and wrap-up
