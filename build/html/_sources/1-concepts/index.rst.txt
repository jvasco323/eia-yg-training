This talk highlights the methods and approaches most widely used so 
far for yield gap decomposition using farmer field data. An overview of how 
crop models and data-driven approaches (e.g., frontier analysis and machine 
learning) have been used for yield gap decomposition is provided and 
illustrated with examples from the literature.
